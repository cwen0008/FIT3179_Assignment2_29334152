            <b>Welcome</b> to my <b>World Economic analysis</b> page. This page will explore a comprehensive dive into the world economy, focusing on key indicators like 
            <strong>Gross domestic product (GDP), per capita GDP, and unicorn company data</strong>, to unravel global economic disparities and trends, 
            making it a valuable resource for students, researchers, and the curious alike.

        <h2>World Economies by <strong>GDP per capita</strong> in USD</h2>
        <div id="choropleth_map" class="viz"></div>
        <p id="section1_text" class="text">
            The <strong>Gross domestic product (GDP)</strong> per capita is the monetary value of a 
            country's total economic output in a year, divided by its population. It represents the 
            average income of a country's residents before taxes.
            <br><br>
            Understanding a country's <strong>GDP per capita</strong> is an important initial step in gaining insights 
            into the country's economic conditions and requirements, as well as the overall quality of 
            life experienced by the average citizen. A country's <strong>GDP per capita</strong> is often strongly 
            correlated with various indicators that assess the social, economic, and environmental 
            welfare of the nation and its population. In this data, we observe that countries like <strong>Norway</strong>, 
            the <strong>United States</strong>, and <strong>Australia</strong> have a high <strong>per capita GDP</strong>.

    <div id="linewithselecter" class="viz"></div>
    <h4>Here is a selection box that allows users to choose and explore the economic data for a specific 
        country</h4>
    <p id="section2_text">
        <strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong> represents the total market value of all final goods and 
        services produced within a country during a specific year. Countries are categorized based 
        on nominal GDP estimates provided by financial and statistical institutions, which are 
        calculated using market or official government exchange rates. 
        <br><br>
        It's important to keep in mind that <strong>GDP</strong> does not account for differences in exchange rates 
        and the cost of living among countries, and therefore, it may not accurately reflect the 
        living standards of a country's residents.
        <br><br>
        Here we can see that the <strong>GDP</strong> of the <strong>United States</strong> and <strong>China</strong> far surpasses all other countries. 
        Among the top five <strong>GDP</strong> countries in the world, <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>Japan</strong>, and <strong>India</strong> have similar <strong>GDP</strong> figures, 
        but due to the vast differences in their populations, the standard of living for their residents 
        varies significantly.

        <p id="section3_text">
            Here we can see the global <strong>GDP</strong> exhibits an overall upward trend, but it is noteworthy that the 
            first year of the pandemic saw a significant decline in worldwide <strong>GDP</strong>. 
            <br><br>
            This visualization presents the total global <strong>GDP</strong> and the <strong>GDP</strong> of the world's top five countries, 
            which can be easily toggled by making a selection in the dropdown menu below. Additionally, a 
            convenient slider tool is provided to select the desired year for closer observation. Here, we

        <div id="barchart" class="viz"></div>
        <p id="section4_text" class="text">
            A unicorn company is a term used in the business and investment world to describe a privately held startup company that has reached a valuation of at least $1 billion. The term was coined to represent the rarity of such companies, similar to how mythical unicorns are rare creatures.
            <br><br>
            Unicorn companies, those valued at <strong>over $1 billion</strong>, are predominantly 
            found in the United States due to its combination of a thriving venture 
            capital landscape, world-renowned universities fostering innovation, a 
            diverse talent pool, a vast domestic market, strong legal protections, 
            a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem, network effects created by existing 
            tech giants, access to customers and partners, cultural encouragement of 
            risk-taking, and a historical legacy of global tech leadership. These factors 
            collectively make the U.S. an ideal environment for startups to flourish and 
            achieve unicorn status. Here I'm counting all countries with fewer than 10 unicorns as others.

    <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(8, 4, 250);">Life expectancy</span> of the World's Top 5 Countries</h2>
    <div id="linewithpoint" class="viz"></div>
    <p id="section5_text">
        In the above chart, we can observe the per capita <strong>life expectancy</strong> of the world's top five <strong>GDP 
        countries</strong> and the global average. Notably, China's per capita <strong>life expectancy</strong> has seen a 
        significant and consistent increase over the past few decades, closely tied to its rapid <strong>GDP 
        growth</strong>. As <strong>GDP</strong> has grown, living standards have improved, leading to an extension in life 
        expectancy.
        <br><br>
        However, among the top five <strong>GDP countries</strong> worldwide, India's per capita <strong>life expectancy</strong> has yet to 
        reach the global average. This is due to India's vast population, which, despite a high <strong>GDP</strong>, 
        results in a low per capita <strong>GDP</strong> and a comparatively lower standard of living, contributing to 
        a reduced per capita <strong>lifespan</strong>.
