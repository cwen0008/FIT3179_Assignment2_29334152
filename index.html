            The <strong>Gross domestic product (GDP)</strong> per capita is the monetary value of a 
            country's total economic output in a year, divided by its population. It represents the 
            average income of a country's residents before taxes.
            <br><br>
            Understanding a country's GDP per capita is an important initial step in gaining insights 
            into the country's economic conditions and requirements, as well as the overall quality of 
            life experienced by the average citizen. A country's GDP per capita is often strongly 
            correlated with various indicators that assess the social, economic, and environmental 
            welfare of the nation and its population. In this data, we observe that countries like Norway, 
            the United States, and Australia have a high per capita GDP.

        <p id="section2_text">
            Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the total market value of all final goods and 
            services produced within a country during a specific year. Countries are categorized based 
            on nominal GDP estimates provided by financial and statistical institutions, which are 
            calculated using market or official government exchange rates. 
            <br><br>
            It's important to keep in mind that GDP does not account for differences in exchange rates 
            and the cost of living among countries, and therefore, it may not accurately reflect the 
            living standards of a country's residents.
            <br><br>
            Here we can see that the GDP of the United States and China far surpasses all other countries. 
            Among the top five GDP countries in the world, Germany, Japan, and India have similar GDP figures, 
            but due to the vast differences in their populations, the standard of living for their residents 
            varies significantly.

            Here we can see the global GDP exhibits an overall upward trend, but it is noteworthy that the 
            first year of the pandemic saw a significant decline in worldwide GDP.

            This visualization presents the total global GDP and the GDP of the world's top five countries,

            convenient slider tool is provided to select the desired year for closer observation. Here, we

        <div id="barchart" class="viz"></div>
        <p id="section4_text" class="text">
            A unicorn company is a term used in the business and investment world to describe a privately held startup company that has reached a valuation of at least $1 billion. The term was coined to represent the rarity of such companies, similar to how mythical unicorns are rare creatures.
            <br><br>
            Unicorn companies, those valued at <strong>over $1 billion</strong>, are predominantly 
            found in the United States due to its combination of a thriving venture 
            capital landscape, world-renowned universities fostering innovation, a 
            diverse talent pool, a vast domestic market, strong legal protections, 
            a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem, network effects created by existing 
            tech giants, access to customers and partners, cultural encouragement of 
            risk-taking, and a historical legacy of global tech leadership. These factors 
            collectively make the U.S. an ideal environment for startups to flourish and 
            achieve unicorn status. Here I'm counting all countries with fewer than 10 unicorns as others.

        <div id="linewithpoint" class="viz"></div>
        <p id="section5_text">
            In the above chart, we can observe the per capita life expectancy of the world's top five GDP 
            countries and the global average. Notably, China's per capita life expectancy has seen a 
            significant and consistent increase over the past few decades, closely tied to its rapid GDP 
            growth. As GDP has grown, living standards have improved, leading to an extension in life 
            expectancy.
            <br><br>
            However, among the top five GDP countries worldwide, India's per capita life expectancy has yet to 
            reach the global average. This is due to India's vast population, which, despite a high GDP, 
            results in a low per capita GDP and a comparatively lower standard of living, contributing to 
            a reduced per capita lifespan.
